# Code Used for Simulation, Data Analysis, and Plotting

- `installed.csv`: R packages and versions used in plotting. This file is generated by `show_installed_r_packages.R`.
- `Data Analysis`: This directory contains all the codes for data processing and analysis for the benchmark.
  - `unagi_bed12.R`: Transform the original BED results produced by UNAGI to BED12.
  - `UNAGIbed_gtf_ensembl_no_cds.py`: Transform the BED12 results of UNAGI to GTF.
  - `get_gffcmp_csv.sh`: Obtain the sensitivity and precision value from the results generated by gffcompare.
  - `get_mean_se.R`: Obtain the mean and standard error from the precision/sensitivity results.
  - `software_params.sh`: All the parameters used to run the evaluated methods.
  - `sqanti_result_conclude.sh`: Extract and merge the results generated by SQANTI3.
  - `benchmark_process.sh`: Codes for processing the data for the comparative analysis.
- `Figures.R`: Script containing plotting codes for each figure in the manuscript (Denoted in codes annotation) except for fig 4B and fig 4C. All the data used in the script can be downloaded from [10.6084/m9.figshare.21524553](https://dx.doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.21524553).
